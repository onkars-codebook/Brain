``While this course will focus on Web APIs, it is important to know that "API" can apply to a broad range of interfaces.

### Web Communication Technologies
######  1. REST
REST is an architectural style for web services, using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for stateless communication, often in JSON or XML format.
##### 2. GraphQL
GraphQL allows clients to request specific data from APIs. It's more efficient than REST for complex queries and supports `real-time data fetching`.
##### 3. WebSockets
WebSockets provide full-duplex communication over a single connection, ideal for real-time applications ` like chat and live notifications`.
##### 4. Webhooks
Webhooks are HTTP callbacks triggered by events, `sending data to a URL when an event occurs` commonly used for real-time updates.
##### 5. SOAP
SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured data in XML format. It's more rigid than REST, supporting complex operations and security.
##### 6. gRPC
gRPC is a high-performance RPC framework that uses HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers for fast, efficient communication, often used in microservices.

##### 7. MQTT
MQTT is a `lightweight messaging protocol` for low-bandwidth, high-latency, or unreliable networks, commonly used in IoT applications.

# Types of APIs

| API Type        | Description                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Public API**  | Open to anyone, can be accessed by any developer.              |
| **Private API** | Restricted to internal use within an organization.             |
| **Partner API** | Shared between organizations with an established relationship. |
|                 |                                                                |
