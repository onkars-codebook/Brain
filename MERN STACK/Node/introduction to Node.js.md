[[Modules in node]]
- Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!
- Node.js runs the `V8 JavaScript engine`,  the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.
- `When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.`
- This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing `thread concurrency`.
