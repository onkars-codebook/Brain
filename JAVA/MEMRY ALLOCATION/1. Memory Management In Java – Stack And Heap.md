  > Stack is used only for execution purpose. Heap is used for storage purpose.

```java
class StackAndHeapMemory {
    static void methodOne() {
        System.out.println("From Method One");
        methodTwo();
    }

    static void methodTwo() {
        System.out.println("From Method Two");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main Method Started");
        methodOne();
        System.out.println("Main Method Ended");
    }
}

```


```
OUTPUT : 

Main Method Started  
From Method One  
From Method Two  
Main Method Ended
```

When you trigger >java StackAndHeapMemory, java command divides allocated memory into two parts. one is ***stack*** and another one is ***heap***

### Understand the concept of the STACK and the HEAP memory.

1. First java command enters the stack memory for execution. First it checks whether the class `StackAndHeapMemory` is loaded in heap memory or not. If it is not loaded, loading operation of class StackAndHeapMemory starts.

2. Randomly one object is created in the heap memory. It is also called **Class Memory**.  After object creation, __all static members are loaded into class memory__. You know that execution of every java program start with main() method. So, java commands calls `main( )` method for execution.

3. `main() `method enters stack memory for execution. First statement in `main() method (Line 16) is executed.` It prints “Main Method Started” on the console. In the second statement (Line 17), it calls `methodOne()` for execution

4. `methodOne()` enters the stack for execution. First statement (Line 5) of `methodOne()` is executed first. It prints “From Method One” on the console. In the second statement (Line 6), it calls `methodTwo()` for execution.
5. once all the execution is getting completed then , it also leaves stack after ___clearing the heap memory___
